      <p>Hello! I'm from a small town called El Cerrito, which is about 2 miles from Berkeley. My Computer Science interest started because of my experience in my high school's Information Technology Academy.
        I learned the basics of web design with HTML/CSS and produced unique websites during my first and second year in the academy. I spent the last year working with Ruby/Ruby on Rails to create applications like video games and web services.
        My programs often produce errors, and future projects will definitely produce errors at first. I've learned to spend lots of time debugging the code in order to pinpoint the error, and hilariously enough, sometimes more errors pop up.
        Eventually, the errors are defeated and I gain a huge boost of confidence and success. This success is motivating, enriching, and more importantly, addicting. I become motivated to create a new application or service that
        implements something that I'm passionate about. For example, I successfully created 2 mechanical keyboards with a partner and programmed the keyboards' firmware in C.


        During the spring of my senior year, 2016, I was accepted into Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python in the first week, and integrated all of those languages in Google's App Engine during the second week.
        This website here is the result of the Chubby Cups' teamwork and passion of CS. Like I've said, success is addicting, so I'll continue to program as a Computer Science major in Berkeley City College and transfer into a 4-year university.
