      <p>Nicole is from Southern California, about half an hour away from Disneyland. She has always had an interest in technology, even though her school never offered any formal training. She learned to use terminal to access information from the Fermi telescope in order to collect data to determine the possibility of dark matter based off the shape of gamma ray emmission from the center of the milky way. From there, Nicole paricipated in Girls Who Code at Google's Kirkland office. There she learned the basics in a variety of coding languages, including HTML/CSS, python, and javascript. For her final project, Nicole along with her group created an interactive game entitled Fear No More where the player would help different people conquer their fears through mini games.</p>
      <p>After graduating from high school, Nicole became a part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. She learned more about languages she had only a taste of and combined them in Google App Engine. Conquering merging errors and other technical difficulties, Nicole is proud of her part as well as the rest of The Chubby Cups team in creating this website. Nicole will continue her passion in technology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</p>

      <h2>Joseph</h2>
      <img id= "picture_joseph" title="source: imgur.com" class="polaroid" src="http://i.imgur.com/BzXLmgT.jpg">
      <p>Joseph is from a small town called El Cerrito, which is about 2 miles from Berkeley. His interest in Computer Science started because of his experience in his high school's Information Technology Academy.
      He learned the basics of web design with HTML/CSS and produced unique websites during his first and second year in the academy. Joseph spent the last year working with Ruby/Ruby on Rails to create applications like video games and web services.
      His programs often produce errors, and future projects will definitely produce errors at first. Joseph learned to spend lots of time debugging the code in order to pinpoint the error, and hilariously enough, sometimes more errors pop up.
      Eventually, the errors are defeated and Joseph gained a huge boost of confidence and success. This success is motivating, enriching, and more importantly, addicting. He become motivated to create a new application or service that implements something that he is passionate about. For example, Joseph successfully created 2 mechanical keyboards with a partner and programmed the keyboards' firmware in C.</p>
      <p>During the spring of Joseph's senior year, 2016, he was accepted into Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. There, he learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python in the first week, and integrated all of those languages in Google's App Engine during the second week.
      This website here is the result of the Chubby Cups' teamwork and passion of CS. Success is addicting, so Joseph will continue to program as a Computer Science major in Berkeley City College and transfer into a 4-year university.</p>
